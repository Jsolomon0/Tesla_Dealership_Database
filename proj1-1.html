  <h2>Project Part 1</h2>
  <h4>(worth 20% of overall Project grade)</h4>
</div>

<h3><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></h3>
<h3>Summary of Deadlines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By <strong>Jan 25:</strong> Find a teammate or complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/4o6LeqRPAinGdPuq9">Google form</a> 
 if you need help
  finding one.</li>
  <li>During the week of <strong>Tue Jan 31 through Mon Feb 6:
  </strong> Meet with a TA to discuss your
  application and design (details below). <strong> This is a required
  meeting.</strong></li>  
  <li>By <strong>Feb 13:</strong> Submit Part 1 of your
  project electronically (details below).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>You will carry out this project in <strong>teams of
two</strong>. If you can't find a teammate, please follow one of these
steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Post a message on Ed asking for a teammate.</li>  
  <li>Complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/4o6LeqRPAinGdPuq9">Google form</a> 
  right away (and definitely <strong>before Jan 25</strong>) asking the TAs to pair you up with another student
  without a teammate. They will do their best to find you a
  teammate.</li>
</ol>

<p>You do not need to notify us of your team composition. Instead, you
and your teammate should assign yourselves to an available "Project
Group" on CourseWorks. For this, go to the "People" section of
CourseWorks for our course. Please join one of the
<strong>already-created "Project Group n" groups</strong>. Please do
<strong>not</strong> create your own group. (We have already created
sufficiently many such groups to accommodate all students in the
course.) </p>

<h4>Important notes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you decide to drop the class, or are even remotely
  considering doing so, please be considerate and <strong>notify your
  teammate immediately</strong>.</li>
  <li>On a related note, do not wait until the day before the deadline
to start working on the project, just to realize then that your
teammate has dropped the class. It is your responsibility to start
working on the project and spot any problems with your teammate early
on.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will do the <strong>project</strong> in teams of two
students. Both students in a team will receive the same grade. Team
partners are expected to fully collaborate with each other on solving
the project. However, communication about project details with
somebody other than your partner is not permitted, and is considered
cheating. Your project submissions--including all programming
code--should be your own team's work. Anyone found submitting another
person's work will be dealt with under the Computer Science
Department's procedures regarding academic honesty (see below). You
should clearly document in your submission any external code libraries
not developed by you that you use in your projects. If in doubt about
what libraries are acceptable, please contact the class staff to
clarify.  You are <strong>not allowed to use any code at all from
other students</strong>, even for parts of the projects that you might
consider as "not essential." Again, your project submissions should be
fully your own team's work, with the exception of documented external
libraries that you clearly disclose in your submission.</p>

<p>If in doubt about what kinds of collaborations or consultations are
allowed, please check with the instructor immediately. Please see the
<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty">policies and
procedures regarding academic honesty</a> (<a
href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty</a>)
for further details.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Project</h3>

<p>You will build a substantial real-world database
application of your choice. This project is split into three
parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1: You will come up with an application of interest to
  you and you will design the associated database.</li>

  <li>Part 2: You will implement your database design on PostgreSQL,
  including example data.</li>

  <li>Part 3: You will have two options, namely, <strong>(3.a) Web
Front-End Option</strong> or <strong>(3.b) Expanded-Design
Option</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Option 3.a:</strong> If you follow the <strong>Web
  Front-End Option</strong> (which is the most fun option!) for Part 3
  of the project, you will write an application in Python that
  manipulates the database through updates and queries, through a
  simple web front-end.</li>
    <li><strong>Option 3.b:</strong> If, instead, you decide to follow
  the <strong> Expanded-Design Option </strong>for Part 3 of the
  project, you will substantially expand your database design from
  Part 1 (see guidelines below), without having to develop a web
  front-end and hence no programming is needed. You will also have
  to incorporate this expanded design into your database of Part
  2.</li>
</ul>
</li>

  <li>Part 4: You will extend the schema of Parts 1 and 2 with object-relational features.</li>

</ul>

<p>Parts 2, 3 and 4 will be based on your description and design
of Part 1.</p>

<h3>Overview of Part 1</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> of this project consists of multiple
steps. At a high level, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a teammate.</li>
<li>Select an application and write a short proposal.</li>
<li>Meet with a course staff member to get feedback on your proposal.</li>
<li>Revise your proposal and then create the full entity-relationship
diagram and corresponding SQL schema for the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pick an application that you will enjoy, since you will be working
on it for a substantial part of the semester! A suggestion is that you
build a database about something that you are interested in --a hobby,
a favorite website, material from another course, a research project,
etc. It's especially nice if you pick an application where you can
populate your database using real, as opposed to fabricated, data.  If
you have an application where you can get a large amount of real data
to populate your database, all the better, but it's not necessary.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble thinking of an application, take a look at
almost any popular website. These sites tend to have similar themes
and many could be reduced to an appropriate scope for the project. For
example, social networks (e.g., Instagram, Reddit, Twitter), shopping
sites (e.g., Etsy, Amazon), or content sites (e.g., The New York
Times) can all be appropriate models. In particular, and as an
example, shopping sites all have a similar theme: products, customers,
orders, shopping baskets, reviews, etc., and typically could be
reduced to make for an interesting and appropriately sized
application.  Try to make your application interesting, including a
variety of different kinds of attribute domains (e.g., strings,
integers, etc.)  and relationships (i.e., with different key and
participation constraints).</p>

<h3>What you need to do for Part 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find a <strong>teammate.</strong></li>
<li>Decide on an application for your project and <strong>write a
document</strong> with the following items to bring to your meeting
with an IA during the week of Jan 31 through Feb 6:
<ul>
  <li><strong>A relatively informal, one-paragraph description of the
application, not to exceed 20 lines or so</strong>, highlighting
interesting and challenging parts. You can ignore all
"security"-related issues (e.g., user authentication, encryption) in
your application. The more concrete your written description, the more
efficient and useful the meeting with the class staff will be. This
paragraph should include:
  <ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>A high-level description of the general domain of the
      application.</li>
    <li>An idea of what entities and relationship sets you will have,
    including attributes and constraints. You don't need to have your
    design completely finalized, though, but of course it will help if
    you bring to the meeting at least a <strong>preliminary
    entity/relationship diagram</strong>, so we encourage you to do
    so. You should pick an application with a schema that is
    relatively substantial, but not too large. As general guidelines,
    your E/R design should be expected to have around 5 to 10 entity
    sets and around 5 to 10 relationship sets. You will get a sense if
    your design is too simple or too complex. Please talk with an IA
      during office hours if you are in doubt about this.</li>
    <li>A specification of whether you will follow the Web Front-End
    Option or the Expanded-Design Option for Part 3.</li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>A brief "data plan,"</strong> providing just two or
    three high-level sentences explaining what data you will use to
    populate your database later on.</li>
  <li><strong>(Web Front-End Option) A description of your user
    interaction plans</strong>: If you will follow the Web Front-End
    Option for Part 3, you should provide specific details as to how
    users will interact with your application. For example, if your
    application is somehow inspired by
    the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a>,
    your description should describe the general "entities" that are
    involved, plus explain that your application might ask users for a
    movie title and return as a result the actors in the movie; you
    might also let users store in the database the fact that they
    liked certain movies and disliked others; finally, given a userid,
    your application might give recommendations on the movies that the
    user might like, given the user's previously recorded preferences,
    according to some simple "recommendation" algorithm.</li>
  <li><strong>(Expanded-Design Option) A description of your design
    expansion plans</strong>: If you will follow the Expanded-Design
    Option for Part 3, you should write a relatively informal,
    one-paragraph description of how you will expand your design in
    Part 3, not to exceed 20 lines or so. The expansion of your
    project in Part 3 should augment your project --in terms of the
    number of entity sets, relationship sets, and overall "complexity"
    of the design-- roughly by 50%.  This expansion should be
    substantial: rather than just adding a few entity sets and
    relationship sets that are overly similar to those in Part 1 of
    the project, you are expected to add a truly novel and significant
    component to your database (following the above "50% increase in
    complexity" guidelines). For example, if your Part 1 database
    follows some variant of the Amazon shopping site, a substantial
    expansion for Part 3 could be the addition of a sophisticated
    "subsystem" for product reviews and ratings, as well as for
    allowing users to vote on the usefulness of the reviews from other
    customers, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>A short description of your contingency
      plan</strong>. Since students do occasionally drop classes, and
      to prevent last-minute surprises, we suggest that you bring to
      the meeting a written "contingency plan" for the unfortunate
      case in which one of the teammates drops the class later in the
      semester. This contingency plan should indicate how you will
      "downgrade" the project to a simpler one in such a
      case <strong>--including in Part 3, whether you follow the Web
      Front-End Option or the Expanded-Design Option--</strong>, so
      that it is appropriate for a single person to complete. As
      general guidelines, your E/R design for a one-person project
      should have around 3 to 7 entity sets and around 3 to 7
      relationship sets. If your teammate drops the class, rather than
      finding a new teammate to complete the project, which is
      problematic for a number of reasons, you will complete the
      "downgraded" version of your original project. Including such a
      contingency plan is optional, but if you choose not to bring it
      to your meeting in written form, for approval, and your teammate
      drops the class later, you will have to complete the original
      project as planned, and no exceptions will be made at that
      point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Meet with an IA during the week of Jan 31 through Feb 6</strong> to discuss your design and plans, and
make sure that they are appropriate (i.e., challenging enough, but not
unrealistically so). <strong>This meeting is required</strong> and
should last up to <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Your grade for Part 1
will be decreased substantially if you don't meet with any of the
class staff. We will have <strong>expanded office hours</strong>
  during that week and you must sign up for a meeting slot ahead of time (details
  of the sign-up process will be announced soon).
<strong>Both team
members must attend</strong> the meeting, at the same time. In advance of this
meeting, email a <strong>pdf copy of the document </strong>described
in the previous point (i.e., in item (2)) to the IA.</li>

<li>After an IA has OKed your general application,
  your data plan, your plans for Part 3, and your contingency plan,
  submit the following three items <strong>electronically on
  CourseWorks</strong> just once per team (not once per teammate) by
  Feb 13:
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>revised version of the document</strong> that you
    brought to your
    meeting with the IA (including the description of
    your application, your data plan, your plans for Part 3, and
    optionally your contingency plan); this revised version should
    incorporate all of the feedback that you received during the
    meeting.</li>
    <li>The <strong>E/R diagram</strong> of your database,
      following the syntax that we saw in class (consistent with the textbook).
      You should specify as
      many of the real-world constraints for your application as
      possible. Write in plain English at the bottom of the diagram
      any constraints that cannot be captured with the E/R syntax that
      we use in our course.
      <br><strong>Note for Expanded-Design Option:</strong> in Part 1,
      you do not need to write or submit an E/R diagram for your Part
      3 expanded design; instead, you should just submit the
      one-paragraph description of your expansion plans for Part 3,
      which you should have brought to the meeting with an IA and <strong>gotten approved during the
      meeting</strong>. You will do the E/R diagram, etc. for Part 3
      later in the semester.</li>
    <li>The <strong>SQL schema</strong> of your database, which you
      should derive by mapping your E/R
      diagram into SQL using the method that we will cover in class.
      You should capture as many of the E/R constraints (e.g., key and
      participation constraints) as possible. Briefly discuss in plain
      English any constraints that you cannot yet reflect in your SQL
      schema.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Important submission instructions:</strong> To submit
    your project, you need to be in the Class view
    (<strong>not</strong> the Group view) and then upload your file or
    files to the "Part 1" assignment under Assignments. Please do not
    upload .zip, .tar, etc. files, but rather you can submit multiple
    (uncompressed) files if necessary. (CourseWorks makes the handling
    of .zip, .tar, etc. files for grading more complex for the IAs.)
    You should submit your project exactly once per team, rather than
    once per student.
</ol>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> Try to meet with an IA <strong>early in the week</strong> of Jan 31. If you
meet with us early in the week, you will still have the chance to
attend any of our expanded office hours later that week to discuss
further and get answers to any questions that you might have.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> If you observe religious
holidays that overlap with this part of the project, please
<a href="mailto:kar@cs.columbia.edu">email the instructor</a> to
arrange for alternative deadlines.</p>

<h3>Grading for Part 1</h3>

<p>Your grade for Part 1 will be split as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Meeting with class staff: 5 points.</strong> If you come
  to the meeting prepared with a hard copy of your document as
  specified above, you can expect to get all points, even if you are
  asked to make changes or revisions to your proposal.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality of revised document for your application: 5
  points.</strong> We will evaluate the overall quality of your final
  description of your application, especially in terms of how
  thoroughly you incorporated any revisions suggested during your
  meeting with the class staff.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality of E/R diagram: 5 points.</strong> We will
  evaluate how well your E/R diagram models your proposed application,
  including how well you modeled any relevant real-world
  constraints.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality of SQL schema: 5 points.</strong> We will
  evaluate how well you mapped your E/R diagram, including
  constraints, into a SQL schema using the technique that we covered
  in class.</li>  
</ol>

<h3><a id="faq"></a>Frequently-Asked Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Q: I have a really cool idea for the Project, but in order
  to implement it I would have to work alone. Can I?</strong><br> A:
  Please modify your project idea so that it becomes appropriate for a
  two-person team. Being able to work with others is a necessary skill
  to develop for the real world.</li>

  <li><strong>Q: Can my team have 3 (or 4, or 12) students for the Project?
  </strong><br> A: No, your team has to have exactly two students,
  so that we can grade all projects as uniformly and fairly as
  possible.</li>

  <li><strong>Q: Why use PostgreSQL for Parts 2 and 3 of the Project?
  Can I use my favorite DBMS instead?</strong><br> A: As much as we
  would like to be more flexible, we just don't have the staff to
  handle several diverse systems and platforms. Unfortunately, you
  cannot use any other DBMS.</li>

  <li><strong>Q: Can I use Ada (or some other language other than
  Python) for the Part 3 Web Front-End Option of the Project?
  </strong><br> A: Please see the answer to the previous
  question. Also, Python is much easier to work with than other
  languages such as Java for our project. Furthermore, Python is a
  great, easy-to-learn, widely used language. If you are fluent in
  Java, you will be able to easily learn the (not-so-deep) level of
  Python needed for our project. </li>
