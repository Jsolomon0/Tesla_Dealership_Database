  <h4>COMS W4111.001-Introduction to Databases<br>
  Spring 2023</h4>
  <h2>Project Part 2</h2>
  <h4>(worth 20% of overall Project grade)</h4>
</div>

<h3>Your team and "project mentor"</h3>

<p>You will do Part 2 of the Project with the same team as for Part
1. If your team partner dropped the class and you did not submit a
contingency plan for this with your Part 1 submission, then
unfortunately you will still have to complete the whole project by
yourself. If you team partner dropped the class and you did submit a
contingency plan for this with your Part 1 submission, then you are
welcome to switch to this reduced version of your project.</p>

<p>For continuity, the IA who grades your Part 1 will grade the
remaining parts of your project. (In many but not all cases, this is
the IA with whom you met to discuss Part 1.) This IA will be your
"project mentor" for the remainder of your project; the name of your
mentor will be included in your graded Part 1. You are welcome to
contact other members of the class staff (including the instructor)
about your project, but your project mentor should be your main
contact, for continuity, since your mentor will be grading all parts
of the project.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, both students in a team will receive the same
grade for the Project. Team partners are expected to fully collaborate
with each other on solving the project. However, communication about
project details with somebody other than your partner is not
permitted, and is considered cheating. If in doubt about what kinds of
consultations are allowed, check with the instructor, or see the
Computer Science Department's policies and procedures
on <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty">academic
honesty</a>. Questions of a general nature that may be of interest to
the whole class should be posted to Piazza.</p>

<h3>Overview of Part 2</h3>

<p>For Part 2 of this project, which you should submit electronically,
you should implement your relations of Part 1 over
our <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/">PostgreSQL</a>
database server and load your tables with some real or realistic data,
as you outlined in Part 1.</p>

<h3>What you need to do for Part 2</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open and set up your Google Cloud account using the
  detailed <a href="gc-setup.html">instructions available
  here</a>. You should have received an email from Harshini with your
  individual Google Cloud code and also with credentials for your
  PostgreSQL database account. If you haven't received this email by the end of the day on Feb 13th
  (please check your @columbia.edu email address),
  please <a href="mailto:hr2538@columbia.edu">contact Harshini
  immediately</a>.</li>

  <li>Familiarize yourself with the PostgreSQL DBMS by reading the
  materials available
  at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/</a>. You
  will be using version 12 on Google Cloud. Please check these
  materials carefully before sending email to the class staff with
    questions on syntax or supported features.</li>

  <li>Use <code>ssh</code> to connect to your Google Cloud virtual
  machine, using the <a href="gc-setup.html">instructions available
  here</a>.</li>

  <li><p>Connect to our section's PostgreSQL database server, which is
  running at <code>34.148.107.47</code>, by running:<br>
    <code>psql -U &lt;uni&gt; -h 34.148.107.47 -d project1</code><br>
  Note: You only need to set up one single PostgreSQL account/database
  per team, even though your team was assigned one account per
  teammate. Pick just one of the two accounts arbitrarily and work on
  it together with your teammate. You will need to let us know with
  your submission which of the team's two PostgreSQL accounts we
  should use for grading (see "What to submit..." section below, item
    2).</p>

  <p>You will be prompted for your PostgreSQL password, which you
  should have received by email from Harshini. To change your PostgreSQL
  password when you first connect, which we recommend, type the
    following inside the psql prompt:<br>
    <code>ALTER USER &lt;uni&gt; WITH PASSWORD '&lt;new
    password&gt;'</code><br> (the single quotes are
    necessary).</p></li>

  <li>Make all suggested changes to the overall design in general, and
  to the SQL schema in particular, once you receive your graded Part
  1. You are likely to have extensive comments from your project
  mentor in your graded Part 1. Your Part 2 grade will be based in
  part on how well you have incorporated your project mentor's
  comments. If you have any questions about these comments once you
  received them, please contact your project mentor as soon as
  possible to clarify.</li>

  <li>Add any additional attribute-based CHECK constraints and
  tuple-based CHECK constraints (as discussed in class) that you need
  so as to express any real-world constraints of your application that
  are missing from your SQL schema. You can
  find <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-constraints.html">helpful
  documentation on constraints in PostgreSQL here</a>. Note that
  PostgreSQL does not support general assertions. You do not need to
  use triggers for this project, and you can ignore any real-world
  constraints that you could not capture with either good-style (as
  discussed in class) attribute- or tuple-based CHECK constraints, or
  with PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, and NOT NULL
  constructs. (Hint: "Good-style" attribute- or tuple-based CHECK
  constraints tend to refer only to the table in which they are
  defined, never to other tables.)</li>

  <li>Create all the SQL tables in your revised SQL schema on your
  PostgreSQL account (see documentation
  on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createtable.html">CREATE
  TABLE</a> and
  on <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype.html">data
  types</a>), including all constraints that you could specify in the
  table declarations as described above. Suggestion: Please use
  <code>varchar(n)</code> with an appropriate value for n as the
  domain for variable-length string attributes such as names, instead
  of a fixed-length char domain. <code>varchar(n)</code> will simplify
  your handling of such attributes in Part 3, particularly if you are
  following the Web Front-End Option.</li>

  <li>Insert into each table in your database, on average, at least 10
  tuples of real or "realistic" data, as you described in your Part 1
  project description. This data will help you test and play with your
  database. Of course, issue queries of your choice to make sure that
  everything works as you intend.</li>

  <li>Write and run three interesting queries, which you will include
  with your submission. Collectively, the three queries should cover
  use of multitable joins, aggregation, and WHERE-clause
  conditions. (These features don't need to appear in each of the
  three queries, but they should appear in at least one of the three
    interesting queries.)</li>
</ol>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: So that you don't exhaust your Google Cloud credits
--and also to avoid wasting energy-- make sure to turn off your
virtual machine on Google Cloud whenever you are not using it, by
following the <a href="gc-setup.html">instructions available
here</a>.</p>

<h3>What to submit and when</h3>

<p>You will submit this part of the project electronically on
CourseWorks via Gradescope. The deadline is <strong>March 6</strong> By now you have joined (for Part 1) one of the
"Project Group" groups on CourseWorks. Just as for Part 1, you
should submit your project exactly once per team, rather than once per
student. You should submit a single
(uncompressed) file containing:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name and UNI of both teammates</li>
<li>The PostgreSQL account name for your database on our server (i.e.,
specify which teammate's UNI we should use to identify the database
for your team); this is the database on which we will base our
grading</li>
<li>Three "interesting" SQL queries over your database, with a
sentence or two per query explaining what the query is supposed to
compute. The goal of these queries is to help us better understand
your application. You will not be graded on these queries, but we
strongly suggest that you submit well formed queries that run without
problems, so please make sure that you have tested your queries by
running them on your database exactly as submitted (use copy and
paste).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grading for Part 2</h3>
<p>Your grade for Part 2 will be split as follows:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Quality of final SQL schema and implementation on
  PostgreSQL: 8 points.</strong> We will evaluate the overall quality
  of your final SQL schema on PostgreSQL, especially in terms of how
  thoroughly you incorporated any revisions suggested by your project
  mentor in the grading of Part 1 of your project.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality of constraint handling: 8 points.</strong> We
  will evaluate how well you managed to capture real-world constraints
  through primary key, foreign key, unique, and good-style attribute-
  and tuple-based CHECK constraints.</li>

  <li><strong>Quality of the real-world (or at least realistic) data
    that you loaded into the database: 4 points.</strong></li>
</ol>
